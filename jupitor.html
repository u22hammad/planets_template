<h2><font color="grey" font size="6">Giant Planet</font></h2>
<p><font color="white" font size="5">Jupiter is classified as a gas giant, primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. It lacks a solid surface and instead consists of dense layers of gas that gradually transition to a liquid state deeper within the planet.<br>
Its immense size and mass distinguish it from the terrestrial planets like Earth. Jupiter's size makes it more akin to a star in terms of its composition, but it didn't acquire enough mass to ignite nuclear fusion in its core and become a star.<br>

<h3><font color="grey" size="6">Size and Mass</font></h3>
<p><font color="white" size="5">Jupiter's large size is evident from its diameter, which measures approximately 139,822 kilometers (86,881 miles) at its equator.<br>
Its mass is approximately 1.898 Ã— 10^27 kilograms, which is about 318 times the mass of Earth. This makes Jupiter by far the most massive planet in our solar system.<br>
</font>
</p>
<h4><font color="grey" size="6">Atmosphere</h4>
<p><font color="white" size="5">Jupiter's atmosphere is predominantly composed of hydrogen (about 75%) and helium (about 24%), with small amounts of other compounds such as methane, ammonia, and water vapor.<br>
The atmosphere exhibits colorful cloud bands that are caused by different atmospheric gases and particles interacting at various altitudes. These bands are created by Jupiter's rapid rotation and strong internal heat.<br>
The Great Red Spot, a giant storm in Jupiter's atmosphere, is one of the most prominent features. It's a persistent anticyclonic storm that has been observed for centuries.<br>
</font>
<h5><font color="grey" size="6">Magnetosphere</font></h5>
<p><font color="white" size="5">Jupiter has a powerful magnetic field, generated by electric currents in its liquid metallic hydrogen core. This magnetic field is the strongest of any planet in our solar system, and it extends far beyond the planet.<br>
The magnetic field traps charged particles, creating intense radiation belts around Jupiter. These radiation belts pose significant hazards to spacecraft and contribute to the planet's dynamic auroras.<br>
</font>

<h6><font color="grey" size="6">Future Exploration</font></h6>
<p><font color="white" size="5">Ongoing and future missions, such as the European Space Agency's JUICE mission and NASA's Europa Clipper mission, aim to further explore Jupiter and its moons.<br>
These missions will focus on studying the potential habitability of Jupiter's moons, particularly Europa, which is believed to have a subsurface ocean beneath its icy crust.<br>
</font>

<p><font color="brown" size="5">Jupiter continues to fascinate scientists and space enthusiasts alike, and further exploration promises to unveil more of its mysteries.</font><br>
