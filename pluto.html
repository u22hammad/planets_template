<h2><font color="grey" size="6">New Horizon Mission</font></h2>
<p><font color="white" size="5">In July 2015, NASA's New Horizons spacecraft made a historic flyby of Pluto, providing the first close-up images and scientific data of the dwarf planet and its moons. The mission revealed a diverse and geologically active world, with icy plains, towering mountains of water ice, and evidence of past and present geological activity.<br></p>
<h3><font color="grey" size="6">Classification As a Dwarf Planet</font></h3>
<p> In 2006, the IAU redefined the criteria for what constitutes a planet, leading to Pluto's reclassification as a dwarf planet. According to the new definition, a planet must orbit the Sun, be spherical in shape, and have cleared its orbit of other debris. While Pluto meets the first two criteria, it has not cleared its orbit of other debris, leading to its reclassification.<br></p>
<h4><font color="grey" size="6">Moons</font></h4>
<p>Pluto has five known moons, the largest of which is Charon. Charon is relatively large compared to Pluto, with a diameter about half that of Pluto's. The other four moons—Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra—are much smaller and were discovered in more recent years<br></p>
<h5><font color="grey"size="6">Orbit And Distance</font></h5>
<p> Pluto orbits the Sun in a highly elliptical orbit that takes about 248 Earth years to complete. Its average distance from the Sun is approximately 5.9 billion kilometers (3.7 billion miles), which is much farther out than the orbit of Neptune.<br></p>
<h6><font color="grey" size="6">Physical Characteristics</font></h6>
<p>Pluto is relatively small, with a diameter of about 2,370 kilometers (1,473 miles), which is about two-thirds the diameter of Earth's moon. It is primarily composed of rock and ice. Pluto has a thin atmosphere primarily composed of nitrogen, with trace amounts of methane and carbon monoxide.<br></p>

<p><font color="pink" size="6">Pluto continues to be a subject of scientific interest and exploration, with ongoing studies aiming to further understand its composition, geology, and place within the context of the outer Solar System<br></p>
